# Custom minion-focused highlights (generated)
#
# Rules included below:
# 1) Weapon-specific block for your minion weapon (replace the placeholder BaseType with the weapon base you use)
# 2) Generic block for non-unique items that have more than 4 sockets (useful for multi-gem/minion setups)
# 3) Import of `unique_items.filter` to highlight your curated uniques (visuals/sound come from that include)

# -------------------------
# 1) Weapon-specific (minion) â€” replace the BaseType value with your weapon base name
# Example: change "Weapon1_BaseType" -> "Windripper" or whatever weapon base you want to target.
